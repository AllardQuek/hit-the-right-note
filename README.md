# _hit the right note_

> _hit (or strike) the right (or wrong) note_: to say or do something in exactly the right (or wrong) way.

==============
Always wanted to play the piano but never know what notes to hit?

- Use the keys **a-f** and **j-;** on your keyboard or **touch** the coloured blocks to play the piano. 
- Use the **space bar** to control the sustain pedal. 
- The more you pretend you're a real player, the better the melody (and you!) will sound.
